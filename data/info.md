## üìñ About The Project

In today's fast-paced digital world, staying informed is crucial, but keeping up with the sheer volume of news is overwhelming. **heirinfo** is a smart news aggregator that aims to solve this problem.

It fetches articles from a multitude of sources, uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the content, and presents it to the user in a clean, digestible, and personalized format. The goal is to provide a signal through the noise, allowing users to consume relevant news efficiently.

## üöÄ Core Functionality

At its core, **heirinfo** performs a three-step process:

1.  **Aggregate:** It continuously scans and pulls articles from a diverse set of news sources, including RSS feeds, official news APIs, and other public outlets.
2.  **Process:** Each article is processed by an AI pipeline. This involves cleaning the text, generating a concise summary, classifying it into relevant categories (e.g., Technology, Politics, Sports), and identifying key entities (people, places, organizations).
3.  **Present:** The processed news is delivered to the user through a clean, minimalist web interface. A recommendation engine works in the background to learn user preferences and create a personalized feed over time.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Multi-Source Aggregation:** Gathers news from thousands of sources to provide comprehensive coverage.
-   **AI-Powered Summarization:** Uses abstractive and extractive summarization models to provide bite-sized summaries of long articles.
-   **Smart Categorization:** Automatically tags and categorizes articles for easy filtering and discovery.
-   **Personalized Feed:** An optional, user-centric feed that learns from your reading habits to suggest articles you'll find interesting.
-   **Semantic Search:** Go beyond keyword search. Find articles based on the meaning and context of your query.
-   **Clean & Readable UI:** A minimalist, responsive, and dark-mode-friendly interface focused on the reading experience.
-   **Save for Later:** Bookmark articles to build your own reading list.

## üèóÔ∏è System Design

The project is built on a modern, microservices-inspired architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.

1.  **Ingestion Service:** A set of workers responsible for fetching new articles from various sources at regular intervals.
2.  **Processing Pipeline:** Once an article is ingested, it's pushed into a queue. A pool of ML workers picks it up to perform summarization, classification, and embedding generation.
3.  **Backend API:** A core RESTful API (built with FastAPI) that serves the processed data to the frontend. It handles user requests, interacts with the databases, and manages logic.
4.  **Frontend Application:** A single-page application (SPA) built with Next.js that provides the user interface.
5.  **Databases:**
    -   **PostgreSQL:** Stores structured data like article metadata, user information, and categories.
    -   **ChromaDB / Milvus:** A vector database to store text embeddings for semantic search and personalization.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   Node.js v18+ and npm/yarn
-   Docker and Docker Compose

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/heirinfo.git](https://github.com/your_username/heirinfo.git)
    cd heirinfo
    ```
2.  **Setup Backend**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cp .env.example .env 
    # Edit .env with your database credentials and API keys
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
3.  **Setup Frontend**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    cp .env.local.example .env.local
    # Edit .env.local if needed
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **Run with Docker (Recommended)**
    ```sh
    # Make sure you have your .env file in the backend directory
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## üéà Usage

Once running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the frontend. The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` for documentation. Browse through the aggregated news, filter by category, or use the search bar to find specific topics.

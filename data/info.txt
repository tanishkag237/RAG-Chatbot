**Apple:**
Apples are round or oval-shaped fruits that come in various colors—red, green, or yellow—depending on the variety. They have smooth, glossy skin and a crisp, juicy interior. The taste ranges from sweet to slightly tart. Apples are rich in dietary fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants that help improve digestion, boost immunity, and support heart health. Eating apples regularly can also aid in maintaining healthy skin and managing weight.

**Mango:**
Mangoes are tropical fruits with smooth, golden-yellow to reddish-green skin and a large seed in the center. Their flesh is soft, juicy, and vibrantly orange, with a rich, sweet aroma and flavor. Mangoes are packed with vitamins A and C, potassium, and folate, making them great for boosting immunity, improving eye health, and promoting glowing skin. They also provide natural sugars that energize the body.

**Banana:**
Bananas have a long, curved shape with thick yellow skin that peels easily to reveal soft, creamy flesh inside. They are mildly sweet and smooth in texture. Bananas are a great source of potassium, vitamin B6, and magnesium, which help regulate blood pressure, support muscle function, and provide instant energy. Their easy digestibility makes them ideal for all age groups.

**Lime:**
Limes are small, round, and green citrus fruits with glossy skin and juicy, acidic flesh. They have a strong, tangy, and refreshing flavor that adds zest to both sweet and savory dishes. Limes are loaded with vitamin C and antioxidants, which strengthen the immune system, improve skin tone, and aid digestion. Their juice is often used in drinks, salads, and marinades for its bright, citrusy kick.

**Strawberry:**
Strawberries are small, heart-shaped red berries with tiny seeds on their outer skin and a sweet, slightly tangy flavor. They are juicy, fragrant, and visually appealing. Strawberries are rich in vitamin C, manganese, and powerful antioxidants that promote skin health, reduce inflammation, and support heart health. They also make an excellent low-calorie snack and dessert ingredient.

**Tomato:**
Tomatoes come in many sizes and colors—red, yellow, orange, or even purple. They have smooth skin, juicy pulp, and a mildly sweet yet tangy flavor. Botanically a fruit but often used as a vegetable, tomatoes are an excellent source of lycopene, vitamin C, and potassium. These nutrients help lower the risk of heart disease, improve skin health, and protect against certain cancers. Tomatoes are versatile and can be eaten raw, cooked, or blended into sauces and soups.
